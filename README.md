# Hi 👋, I'm Saiem (Saiem Ilyas)

I'm currently pursuing a B.Sc. (Hons.) in Data Science (Business) at York University. I'm passionate about learning across disciplines, from data science, AI/ML, and software development to business strategy, marketing, and the psychology behind consumer behavior. I'm especially fascinated by how big tech companies leverage data and psychology to scale their impact.

I’m driven by the desire to create meaningful change through whatever I do. Whether that’s building a startup, launching a product, or analyzing patterns in data. I love working on projects that blend technology, creativity, and real-world impact.

### 🚀 Projects:

- ⚡ **Spotify Collaboration and Popularity Analysis** - Analyzed 20K+ Spotify tracks to evaluate how artist collaborations influence popularity and musical features. Engineered features such as is_collaboration and is_highly_popular; conducted extensive EDA and hypothesis testing. Built and evaluated Decision Tree and Random Forest models to predict popularity (Random Forest R² = 0.50). Identified statistically significant differences in danceability and acousticness between solo and collaborative tracks.

- 🔭 **Ocean Oxygen Level Analysis** - A machine learning and Data Science project to predict ocean oxygen levels based on depth, temperature, and salinity. Built with Python, pandas, and scikit-learn. Achieved R² = 0.82 using Random Forest Regression.
