# Hi 👋, I'm Saiem (Saiem Ilyas)

I'm currently pursuing a B.Sc. (Hons.) in Data Science (Business) at York University. I'm passionate about learning across disciplines, from data science, AI/ML, and software development to business strategy, marketing, and the psychology behind consumer behavior. I'm especially fascinated by how big tech companies leverage data and psychology to scale their impact.

I’m driven by the desire to create meaningful change through whatever I do. Whether that’s building a startup, launching a product, or analyzing patterns in data. I love working on projects that blend technology, creativity, and real-world impact.

One of my current ventures is Fixxer, a local job bidding platform designed to simplify how people find and hire trusted service providers in their area.
