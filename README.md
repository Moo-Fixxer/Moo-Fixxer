# Hi 👋, I'm Saiem (Saiem Ilyas)

I'm currently pursuing a B.Sc. (Hons.) in Data Science (Business) at York University. I'm passionate about learning across disciplines, from data science, AI/ML, and software development to business strategy, marketing, and the psychology behind consumer behavior. I'm especially fascinated by how big tech companies leverage data and psychology to scale their impact.

I’m driven by the desire to create meaningful change through whatever I do. Whether that’s building a startup, launching a product, or analyzing patterns in data. I love working on projects that blend technology, creativity, and real-world impact.

- ⚡ **Spotify Collaboration and Popularity Analysis**

Role: Data Scientist / Analyst
Tools: Python, Jupyter Notebook, pandas, NumPy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn
ML Models: Random Forest Regression, Linear Regression

-Modeled oceanic oxygen levels using environmental factors (depth, salinity, temperature)

-Cleaned missing data, removed outliers with z-scores, normalized features using StandardScalerBuilt and compared regression models

-Best result: Random Forest R² = 0.8222, MAE = 0.52

-Used cross-validation and visualization (scatterplots, time series, correlation matrices) to support conclusions

-Data Set Source: https://ssc.ca/en/case-study/analysis-historical-environmental-data-collected-ocean-gliders-gulf-saint-lawrence

- 🔭 **Ocean Oxygen Level Analysis** - A machine learning and Data Science project to predict ocean oxygen levels based on depth, temperature, and salinity. Built with Python, pandas, and scikit-learn. Achieved R² = 0.82 using Random Forest Regression.
